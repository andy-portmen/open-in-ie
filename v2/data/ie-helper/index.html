    <h1>One Last Step</h1>
    <p>For the extension to connect to send links in the Internet Explorer, you need to download, unzip and install this open-source native client. It acts as a wrapper to connect your browser to a system-level application.</p>
    <ul id="steps">
      <li class="step1">Click <a href="#" data-cmd="download">here</a> to download the package for your operating system (Window, Mac, and Linux are currently supported) or click <a href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/releases" target="_blank">here</a> to browse all available download options.</li>
      <li>Extract the downloaded package in a local directory</li>
      <li class="linux">Now open a terminal in this directory (the directory that contains <code>install.sh</code> and <code>uninstall.sh</code>), and run <code>./install.sh</code> script</li>
      <li class="windows">Now double-click the <code>install.bat</code> script.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="flex">
      <input type="button" data-cmd="check" value="Check Connection">

      <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To completely remove this native client, run <code class="linux">./uninstall.sh</code><code class="windows">uninstall.bat</code>.</li>
        <li>The installer script copies a few files to two different locations for your browser to be able to detect this native client. If you already have NodeJS in your system, the installed version of NodeJS will be used. So please make sure you have an up-to-date version of NodeJS installed. If you don't have this application, the portable version will be used. Read more <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client">here</a>.</li>
        <li>To make sure the native client is accessible, click on the "<a href="#" data-cmd="check">Check Connection</a>" button. <span id="alternative">If you still get this page even when the "Check Button" reports successful connection, it means the application cannot be accessed (path is not correct in the <a href="#" data-cmd="options">options page</a>)</span>. If the path to the Internet Explorer is correct and the native client is connected, you can debug the connection by enabling console logs in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/enable-logging">Chrome and Opera</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Browser_Console">Firefox</a>.</li>

      <h4>IE's Supported Command-Line Options:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-embedding</code>: Starts Windows Internet Explorer through OLE embedding (such as the WebBrowser Control).</li>
        <li><code>-extoff</code>: Windows Internet Explorer 7 and later versions. Starts Internet Explorer in No Add-ons mode, which you can use to troubleshoot problems with browser add-ons.</li>
        <li><code>‑framemerging</code>: Windows Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Enables Internet Explorer to opportunistically merge new frame processes into existing frame processes.</li>
        <li><code>-k</code>: Starts Internet Explorer in kiosk mode. The browser opens in a maximized window that does not display the address bar, the navigation buttons, or the status bar.</li>
        <li><code>‑noframemerging</code>: Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Prevents Internet Explorer from opportunistically merging new frame processes into existing frame processes. This has the effect of preventing session merging as well, because session merging can only happen with a merged frame process. You can also set this option via registry key</li>
        <li><code>-nohangrecovery</code>: Windows Internet Explorer 9. Prevents Internet Explorer from restarting a tab when it stops responding. This option enables application developers to use debugging tools to investigate problems with Browser Helper Objects (BHOs), Microsoft ActiveX controls, and other browser extentions.</li>
        <li><code>-private</code>: Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Starts Internet Explorer with InPrivate Browsing set to active. For more information</li>
        <li><code>‑nosessionmerging</code>: Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Prevents Internet Explorer from merging tab processes and thus sharing session cookies across tabs. Even if you have the –framemerging feature turned on (which it is by default; see above), specifying this option will isolate your tabs into separate processes and prevent session sharing, even if those tabs are associated with the same frame process. You can also set this option via registry key</li>
        <li><code>‑sessionmerging</code>: Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. Enables Internet Explorer to opportunistically merge new tab processes into existing tab processes within a merged frame process. By default, this setting is turned on. However, if you set the SessionMerging registry key to zero (thus disabling session merging), you can use this command line option to override that setting.</li>
